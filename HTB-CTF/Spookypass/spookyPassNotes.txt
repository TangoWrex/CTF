Hack The Box Spooky Pass 

https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/SpookyPass


Summary: I learned about Stack Canaries in the proccess of trying to understand the specific sizes being assigned to variables. Upon further investigation I quickly say strcmp function comparing the value from fgets with the password which allowed me to get the flag. 





Note - easy locate for ghidra exe

find . -name "ghidraRun" -exec realpath {} \;


1) Downloaded the pass exe and ran it. Requests a password after execution, fails if password not correct as expected

2) open in ghidra. 

analysis: 

- I wanted to understand 'in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28 purpose. I identified this CTF is focused on Stack Canaries. 


char 1stCompareValue [136];


  fgets(1stCompareValue,0x80,stdin);
  pcVar2 = strchr(1stCompareValue,10);
  if (pcVar2 != (char *)0x0) {
    *pcVar2 = '\0';
  }

Reads the first 127 characters and removes newlines and null terminates the string. 


Identified password : s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5 and retrieved flag. 



3) I wanted to understand the bytes and size being assigned to variable local_10. 

"

long in_FS_OFFSET
long local_10;  
local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);


4) at this moment I think this CTF is a stack smash / stack canary. [FS_OFFSET + 0x28]

5) Examing the stack canary with GDB

5a) Start GDB and Run the Binary
"""
gdb ./binary
b main   # Set a breakpoint at main
r        # Run the program


stdout:
(gdb) b *main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1189

"""



5b) Get the FS Segment Base Address
"""
info reg fs_base

stdout:
Breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555555189 in main ()
(gdb) x/gx $fs:0x28
A syntax error in expression, near `:0x28'.
(gdb) info reg fs_base
fs_base        0x7ffff7fa3740      140737353758528
"""

fs_base holds the base address of the FS segment.
The specific offset 0x28 (fs:[0x28]) stores the stack canary.
Following 'fs_base' the first number is the hex value and the second is the decimal representation of the same value



5c) Reading the Stack Canary (fs:[0x28])

Now we know the stack canary is fs_base
